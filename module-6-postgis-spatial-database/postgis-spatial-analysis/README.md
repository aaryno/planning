## üîß PostGIS Quick Reference

### Essential Spatial Functions
```sql
-- Spatial Relationships

ST_Contains(geom1, geom2)        -- Test if geom1 contains geom2
ST_Within(geom1, geom2)          -- Test if geom1 is within geom2
ST_DWithin(geom1, geom2, distance) -- Test if within distance

-- Spatial Operations  
ST_Buffer(geometry, radius)      -- Create buffer around geometry
ST_Intersection(geom1, geom2)    -- Return intersection geometry
ST_Union(geometry_set)           -- Combine multiple geometries
ST_Difference(geom1, geom2)      -- Return geom1 minus geom2

-- Measurements
ST_Area(geometry)                -- Calculate area
ST_Length(geometry)              -- Calculate length  
ST_Distance(geom1, geom2)        -- Calculate distance
ST_Perimeter(geometry)           -- Calculate perimeter

-- Coordinate Transformations
ST_Transform(geometry, srid)     -- Transform coordinate system
ST_SRID(geometry)                -- Get spatial reference ID

-- Data Inspection
ST_GeometryType(geometry)        -- Get geometry type
ST_AsText(geometry)              -- Convert to Well-Known Text
ST_Extent(geometry_set)          -- Calculate bounding box
```

### Common Coordinate Systems
- **EPSG:4326** - WGS84 Geographic (longitude/latitude)
- **EPSG:3857** - Web Mercator (meters, good for web maps)
- **EPSG:26913** - UTM Zone 13N (meters, accurate for Colorado)

### Distance and Area Conversions
```sql
-- Distance conversions
meters_to_miles = meters / 1609.34
meters_to_feet = meters * 3.28084

-- Area conversions  
sq_meters_to_acres = sq_meters / 4047
sq_meters_to_sq_miles = sq_meters / 2589988
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common PostGIS Errors

**"function st_intersects does not exist"**
- **Solution**: Ensure PostGIS extension is installed: `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`

**"transform: couldn't project point"**
- **Solution**: Check SRID values and ensure coordinates are within valid bounds
- Verify coordinate system definitions in `spatial_ref_sys` table

**"parse error - invalid geometry"**
- **Solution**: Check for valid geometry construction
- Use `ST_IsValid(geometry)` to test geometry validity

### Performance Tips

**For large datasets:**
- Always use spatial indexes (created automatically with GIST)
- Transform to projected coordinates (3857 or 26913) for distance/area calculations
- Use ST_DWithin() instead of ST_Distance() for "within distance" queries

**Query optimization:**
- Place most selective conditions first in WHERE clauses
- Use LIMIT when testing queries on large datasets
- Consider using ST_Simplify() for complex geometries when appropriate
