Background:

Our working directory is planning/module-5-python-gis-programming/
This is a course named GIST 604B - Open Source GIS Programming. This is part of the GIST curriculum at the U of A.
The course descriptions for other courses in the programm can be found in the reference/ directory (including that of GIST604B which you can ignore since we will update it later).

Ignore the gist-604b directories for now. They represent the assignments before this current course refresh which is the point of this chat session with you.

Only work in module-5-python-gis-programming. Use reference/ to see what other courses students will have taken before this one. 

Background: The students are not good programmers so they need a lot of guidance. The course map for this course is in planning/course_map.md. Refer to that to see what other concepts students will have learned before and will learn after.
All data should be accessible to the students either in this repository or from downloads. Scripts will be provided for any assignment that needs the data.

Any programming assignments should be testable in CI but there should be companion jupyter notebooks so students can learn how to use the tools and visualize the data as they work on the assignments. 

All assignments should be automatically graded in GitLab Workflows. The students will learn git and open source in modules 0 and 1. 

Use the module 5 python-geopandas-intro as a template for all assignments.  

The README.md of the assignment templates should reference the fact that many (most) of the students are not in a Unix environment nor are Unix savvy. It should be clear to Windows users that much of the open source world operates best in a unix environment but not necessarily so. Point out how Windows users can perform the same tasks or else point out that the codespace provides the unix environment for them to work in. Unfortunately the instructor cannot assist with windows-related issues. 

Since this course is the last course in the GIS Programming specialization, build on concepts learned in previous courses (reference/ directory).

Action: Look at the project status for python-pandas and do what needs to be done to ensure that the assignment as written is do-able by the students, testable in CI, and automatically graded in GitLab Workflows.
