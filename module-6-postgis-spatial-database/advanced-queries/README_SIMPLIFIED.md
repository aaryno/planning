## üß™ Testing Your Work

After completing each function, test it:

```bash
# Test individual parts
python -m pytest tests/test_raster_basics.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_band_math.py -v  
python -m pytest tests/test_applications.py -v

# Test everything
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## üí° Helpful Tips

### Getting Stuck?
1. **Read the error messages carefully** - they often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check your variable names** - make sure they match the function requirements
3. **Print intermediate values** - use `print()` to see what your variables contain
4. **Use the sample data** - test with the provided files first

### Common Beginner Mistakes:
- Forgetting to import numpy as `np`
- Not handling nodata values (they show up as `nan`)
- Mixing up coordinate order (x,y vs y,x)
- Not closing raster files properly (use `with` statements)

### Debugging Example:
```python
def read_raster_info(raster_path):
    with rasterio.open(raster_path) as src:
        # Add print statements to debug
        print(f"Width: {src.width}")
        print(f"Height: {src.height}")
        print(f"Bands: {src.count}")
        
        # Your code here
        info = {
            'width': src.width,
            'height': src.height,
            # ... etc
        }
        return info
```

## üÜò Getting Help

### If You're Stuck:
1. **Re-read the function comments** - they contain step-by-step instructions
2. **Look at the test files** - they show examples of how functions should work
3. **Check the sample data** - make sure you understand what you're working with
4. **Ask for help** - post in the discussion forum or attend office hours

### Common Questions:

**Q: "My function returns None instead of a value"**
A: Make sure you have a `return` statement at the end of your function.

**Q: "I get a 'module not found' error"**  
A: Check that you're in the right directory and rasterio is installed.

**Q: "My NDVI values look wrong"**
A: Make sure you're using the right bands and handling nodata properly.

**Q: "Tests are failing but my function seems right"**
A: Check that your return format matches exactly what the tests expect.

## üèÜ Success Tips

1. **Start simple** - Get basic functionality working first
2. **Test frequently** - Run tests after each function
3. **Read carefully** - The comments tell you exactly what to do
4. **Don't overthink it** - These functions are simpler than they might seem
5. **Use the resources** - Sample data and tests are there to help you
