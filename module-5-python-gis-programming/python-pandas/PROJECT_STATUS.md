## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

### 🟡 Minor Issues (Should Address)

#### 1. **Incomplete Sample Data**
**Problem:** Only one sample CSV file present in data/ directory
**Impact:** Students may need more varied datasets for testing
**Status:** Low priority - current data sufficient for core learning
**Solution:** 
- Current: `sample_environmental_data.csv` exists
- Enhancement: Could add `infrastructure_inventory.csv` and `environmental_stations.csv` mentioned in README

#### 2. **Missing Test Coverage Files**
**Problem:** `test_file_operations.py` not present in tests/ directory
**Impact:** Incomplete automated testing coverage
**Priority:** Medium - should be added for completeness
**Solution:** Create comprehensive tests for file I/O operations

#### 3. **Jupyter Notebook Companion Missing**
**Problem:** No companion notebooks for interactive learning
**Impact:** Students have fewer visualization and exploration opportunities
**Priority:** Low - assignment works well as pure coding exercise
**Enhancement:** Could add notebooks for data exploration and visualization

### 🟢 No Critical Issues

All core functionality is implemented and working. The assignment is ready for student deployment.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Optional Enhancements (This Week)

1. **📊 Add Missing Test File**
   ```bash

   - Include error handling and metadata validation tests

2. **📊 Enhance Sample Data**
   - Add the additional CSV files mentioned in README
   - Ensure varied data types and structures for comprehensive testing

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

3. **📖 Optional Jupyter Notebooks**
   - Create `notebooks/` directory if desired
   - Add interactive exploration notebooks for visual learners
   - Include data visualization examples using matplotlib/seaborn

4. **🎯 Student Experience Testing**
   - Run complete assignment as student would
   - Time estimate validation (currently estimated 4-6 hours)
   - Identify any workflow bottlenecks

### Long-term Enhancements (Next Month)

5. **📈 Advanced Features**
   - Add performance profiling examples
