## üéØ Purpose of This Document

This document provides instructor guidance for managing the **Advanced Raster Processing assignment** with particular focus on the **technical challenges of raster processing environments** and **Windows compatibility issues** common in geospatial education.

## üö® The Raster Processing Challenge

### Why Raster Processing is Technically Complex

**GDAL Dependency Hell:**
- Rasterio depends on GDAL, which has complex system-level dependencies
- GDAL requires PROJ, GEOS, and numerous format-specific libraries
- Version mismatches between GDAL, rasterio, and system libraries are common
- Windows installations are notoriously difficult and fragile

**Memory Management Issues:**
- Large raster files can easily exceed available RAM
- Students often attempt to load multi-gigabyte files entirely into memory
- Windows memory management differs from Unix systems
- Garbage collection behavior varies across platforms

**File Format Complexities:**
- COG (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF) creation requires specific GDAL configurations
- STAC API access requires network configuration and authentication
- Satellite imagery formats have complex metadata structures
- Compression and optimization settings are platform-dependent

### Educational Impact on Students

**Common Student Struggles:**
- "ImportError: No module named 'rasterio._shim'" on Windows
- Out of memory errors when processing large rasters
- COG validation failures due to missing overviews
- STAC API timeouts and authentication issues
- Confusion between raster coordinate systems and pixel coordinates

**Why This Assignment is Different:**
- More computationally intensive than vector processing
- Requires understanding of both programming and remote sensing concepts
- Industry-relevant workflows (COG, STAC) that students haven't encountered
- Performance optimization is essential, not optional

## ‚úÖ Environment Solutions

### GitHub Codespaces (Strongly Recommended)

**Why Codespaces is Critical for Raster Processing:**
- Pre-configured GDAL installation with all drivers
- Sufficient memory and computing resources for raster operations
- Consistent network configuration for STAC API access
- Pre-installed optimization libraries (dask, numba)
- Ubuntu environment matches production GIS servers

**Codespaces Configuration Benefits:**
- 4-core, 8GB RAM instances handle typical assignment datasets
- Fast SSD storage for temporary raster processing
- Reliable network access for satellite data APIs
- Consistent Python 3.13 environment across all students

### Local Development Challenges

**Windows-Specific Raster Issues:**
- GDAL installation requires Visual Studio Build Tools
- Memory mapping issues with large COG files
- Path length limitations affect deep directory structures
- Windows Defender can interfere with raster file operations
- DLL conflicts between different geospatial packages

**Mac/Linux Considerations:**
- Homebrew/conda GDAL installations can conflict
- ARM Mac compatibility issues with some geospatial libraries
- Memory limitations on older systems
- Network security restrictions in some environments

### Communication Templates

**For Raster Processing Environment Issues:**
```
Hi [Student],

I see you're experiencing [specific raster processing issue]. This type of 
issue is exactly why we require GitHub Codespaces for this assignment.

Raster processing requires:
- Properly configured GDAL installation
- Sufficient memory for large file operations  
- Reliable network access for satellite data
- Consistent library versions

Please switch to GitHub Codespaces:
1. Go to your assignment repository
2. Click "Code" ‚Üí "Create codespace on main"
3. Wait for the environment to initialize
4. All raster processing libraries will be ready

I cannot troubleshoot local environment issues, but I'm happy to help 
with raster processing concepts and assignment requirements once you're 
in the standardized environment.

Best regards,
[Instructor]
```

## üìä Assignment Structure and Expectations

### Learning Progression

**Part 1: Raster Processing Fundamentals (12 pts)**
- Students often struggle with: metadata interpretation, nodata handling
- Common errors: not checking for valid CRS, ignoring nodata values
- Success indicators: proper error handling, meaningful statistics

**Part 2: STAC Integration (8 pts)**  
- Students often struggle with: API authentication, network timeouts

- File I/O operations can be slower in containers

**Recommended Grading Approach:**
- Use mock objects for STAC API tests where possible
- Implement timeouts for long-running operations
- Focus on algorithm correctness over absolute performance
- Validate COG structure rather than absolute optimization metrics

## üîß Technical Implementation Guide

### Codespaces Configuration

**Required .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "Raster Processing Environment",
  "image": "ghcr.io/osgeo/gdal:ubuntu-small-3.8.0",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.13"
    }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup_student_environment.py",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
        "ms-python.black-formatter"
      ]
    }
  },
  "hostRequirements": {
    "memory": "8gb",
    "cpus": 4
  }
}
```
