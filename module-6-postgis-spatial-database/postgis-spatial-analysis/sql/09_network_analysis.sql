-- OBJECTIVE: Analyze transportation network connectivity and accessibility
-- to model optimal routing and identify transportation infrastructure gaps.
--
-- BUSINESS CONTEXT: Transportation network analysis is critical for
-- emergency response planning, tourism accessibility, and infrastructure
-- investment decisions. Understanding route efficiency, connectivity, and
-- accessibility helps optimize resource allocation and improve visitor
-- services in protected areas.
--
-- LEARNING GOALS:
-- - Apply network analysis concepts using PostGIS spatial functions
-- - Model transportation accessibility and routing efficiency
-- - Analyze network connectivity and identify infrastructure gaps
-- - Synthesize multiple spatial analysis techniques for complex problem-solving
--
-- POINTS: 2 (Problem statement and strategic hints only)
-- ===================================================================

-- PROBLEM STATEMENT:
--
-- The National Park Service needs to optimize transportation and emergency
-- response planning across the Colorado Rocky Mountain region. They require
-- a comprehensive network analysis that evaluates:
--
-- 1. ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS: How accessible are visitor facilities from
--    major transportation corridors? Which facilities are isolated?
--
-- 2. ROUTING EFFICIENCY: What are the most and least efficient routes
--    between critical facilities (visitor centers and ranger stations)?
--    Where do routes deviate significantly from straight-line distances?
--
-- 3. EMERGENCY RESPONSE MODELING: From each ranger station, what is the
--    maximum distance to reach all visitor facilities and monitoring stations?
--    Which areas have inadequate emergency response coverage?
--
-- 4. NETWORK CONNECTIVITY: Which transportation routes provide the most
--    critical connectivity? If a route were closed, which facilities would
--    become more isolated?

-- STRATEGIC APPROACH HINTS:

-- STRATEGY 1: Accessibility Modeling
-- Calculate minimum distances from each facility to the nearest major
-- transportation route (Interstate Highway, US Highway, Scenic Highway).
-- Classify facilities by accessibility level and identify those requiring
-- infrastructure improvements.

-- STRATEGY 2: Route Efficiency Analysis
-- Compare network routing distances versus straight-line distances between
-- facility pairs. Calculate "detour factors" and identify routes with
-- poor efficiency that might benefit from direct connections.

-- STRATEGY 3: Emergency Response Coverage
-- Model service areas around ranger stations using realistic travel distances.
-- Identify facilities and monitoring stations outside optimal response ranges.
-- Calculate maximum response distances and times.

-- STRATEGY 4: Network Criticality Assessment
-- Analyze which transportation routes connect the most facilities or provide
-- unique connectivity. Model the impact of losing critical route segments.

-- KEY SPATIAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO EMPLOY:
-- • ST_Distance() for multi-modal distance calculations
-- • ST_ClosestPoint() and ST_ShortestLine() for network connections
-- • ST_DWithin() for service area modeling
-- • Complex spatial joins across multiple transportation and facility layers
-- • Aggregate functions to summarize network characteristics
-- • Conditional logic to classify accessibility and efficiency levels

-- TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
-- • Use appropriate coordinate transformations for accurate distance measurements
-- • Implement realistic travel assumptions (average speeds, terrain factors)
-- • Create meaningful classification systems for accessibility and efficiency
-- • Provide quantitative metrics supporting infrastructure recommendations
-- • Handle edge cases (isolated facilities, multiple route options)

-- ANALYTICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
-- Your analysis should produce actionable intelligence including:
-- • Facility accessibility rankings with improvement recommendations
-- • Route efficiency ratings identifying infrastructure investment priorities
-- • Emergency response coverage assessment with service gap identification
-- • Network criticality analysis highlighting vulnerable transportation links
-- • Executive summary metrics suitable for park management decision-making

-- BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE GOALS:
-- • Which facilities should receive priority for transportation infrastructure?
-- • What are the most critical transportation routes that must be maintained?
-- • Where should additional ranger stations be located to improve coverage?
-- • Which routes provide redundant connectivity versus unique connections?
-- • How would seasonal road closures impact overall network accessibility?

-- IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE:
-- You must design and implement the complete analytical framework.
-- No code templates provided - demonstrate your mastery of PostGIS
-- spatial analysis by creating original network analysis algorithms.

-- EXPECTED SOPHISTICATION LEVEL:
-- This analysis should demonstrate advanced spatial analysis capabilities
-- comparable to professional transportation consulting work. Your approach
-- should be methodologically sound, computationally efficient, and
-- produce actionable business intelligence for park management.

-- SUCCESS INDICATORS:
-- ☐ Comprehensive facility accessibility assessment with quantified metrics
-- ☐ Route efficiency analysis identifying optimization opportunities
-- ☐ Emergency response coverage modeling with service gap identification
-- ☐ Network criticality analysis supporting infrastructure prioritization
-- ☐ Professional-quality recommendations supported by spatial evidence
-- ☐ Efficient query design demonstrating PostGIS expertise

-- NOTE: This is an open-ended analysis challenge. Demonstrate creativity,
-- technical skill, and business acumen in your approach. There are multiple
-- valid solutions - focus on creating valuable insights for decision-makers.
