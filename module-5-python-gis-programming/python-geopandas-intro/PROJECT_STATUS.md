## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)

#### 1. **Sample Data Missing**
**Problem:** `data/` directory is empty, preventing notebook execution
**Impact:** Students cannot run tutorials immediately
**Solution:** 
- ✅ Created `data/create_sample_data.py` script (369 lines)
- Generates Arizona-based spatial datasets (cities, counties, highways, parks)
- Supports multiple formats (GeoJSON, Shapefile, CSV)

#### 2. **Type Safety Issues**
**Problem:** Import resolution and type hint errors in source code
**Impact:** IDE warnings and potential runtime errors
**Solution:**
- ✅ Fixed CRS import issues in `spatial_data_loading.py`
- ✅ Added proper Optional type hints for nullable parameters
- Added PyProj dependency for CRS operations

#### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline Errors**
**Problem:** 450+ errors in automated grading workflow
**Impact:** Automated assessment non-functional
**Status:** Needs comprehensive review and testing

### 🟡 Enhancement Opportunities

#### 1. **Testing Coverage** 
**Current:** Only `test_spatial_data_loading.py` exists
**Needed:** Test files for all four modules
**Priority:** High - required for automated grading

#### 2. **Error Handling**
**Current:** Basic error handling in place
**Enhancement:** More specific error messages and recovery strategies
**Priority:** Medium

#### 3. **Performance Optimization**
**Current:** Some functions flagged for high complexity (15+ cyclomatic)
**Enhancement:** Refactor large functions into smaller components
**Priority:** Low
