## 📖 Overview

This document provides standardized guidelines for developing and updating assignments in Module 6 of GIST 604B. It serves as a reference for consistent assignment structure, student-centered design, and professional development integration across the **complete PostGIS assignment portfolio**.

### 🎯 Target Audience
- **Students**: GIS professionals learning spatial database management for career advancement
- **Background**: Limited database experience, practical needs-focused
- **Goals**: Apply PostGIS skills to real-world spatial data management and analysis tasks
- **Context**: Professional development for enterprise GIS environments

### 📖 Assignment Platform
Students will complete this assignment using GitHub Classroom and GitHub Codespaces. They will be provided with a Docker-based PostGIS environment for development and testing. This environment ensures consistent PostgreSQL/PostGIS setup, eliminating environment issues. It will be defined as a `docker-compose.yml` file. The Codespace will start the `docker compose up` command automatically when the student opens the Codespace. 

### Interactive SQL
Students will initially use the `PostgreSQL` extension by `Chris Kolkman` to interact with the database. For the more advanced tasks they may use the `psql` command-line tool to run single SQL queries or scripts. 

### Automated testing and grading
We will provide .sql files for students to edit and submit for automated testing and grading. There will be clear directions given to students about how to test the SQL files both to see the results of their queries and a test script to verify their results match the expected output.

### ⭐ Unified Standard Established
This document represents the **definitive standard** for Module 6 assignment development, established through the successful integration of professional grading automation across **Docker-based PostGIS environments**. This unified approach provides superior analytics, establishes industry-standard database practices, and prepares students for enterprise GIS roles.

#### Key Success Metrics Achieved
