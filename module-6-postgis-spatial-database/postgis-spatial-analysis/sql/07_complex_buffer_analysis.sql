-- PostGIS Spatial Analysis Assignment - Query 7
-- Complex Buffer Analysis and Service Area Modeling
-- ===================================================================
--
-- OBJECTIVE: Perform advanced buffer operations including multi-distance
-- buffers, buffer intersections, and comprehensive service area analysis.
--
-- BUSINESS CONTEXT: Advanced buffer analysis is essential for facility
-- planning, emergency response modeling, and accessibility studies.
-- This includes creating multiple service zones, finding buffer overlaps,
-- and analyzing coverage gaps in service delivery.
--
-- LEARNING GOALS:
-- - Create multi-distance buffer zones for service area analysis
-- - Calculate buffer intersections and overlaps between facilities
-- - Perform gap analysis to identify underserved areas
-- - Master complex buffer-based spatial analysis workflows
--
-- POINTS: 2 (Minimal guidance - requires independent spatial thinking)
-- ===================================================================

-- Your Task: Build a comprehensive service area analysis using complex buffer operations
-- Create multiple buffer zones, find overlaps, and identify service gaps

-- PART A: Multi-Zone Service Area Analysis
-- Create 3-mile and 5-mile service areas around visitor centers
-- and analyze how they overlap with different land use zones

SELECT
    -- TODO: Select facility information and create multi-distance buffers
    -- Create both 3-mile and 5-mile service areas
    -- Calculate the area of each buffer zone
    -- Determine which land use zones each buffer intersects
    -- Show the percentage of each buffer that falls within wilderness areas

-- PART B: Buffer Intersection Analysis
-- Find where facility service areas overlap and calculate shared coverage zones
-- Identify facilities that have overlapping 5-mile service areas

SELECT
    -- TODO: Find pairs of visitor centers with overlapping 5-mile buffers
    -- Calculate the area of overlap between facility service areas
    -- Determine which facilities provide redundant coverage
    -- Classify overlap significance (high/medium/low based on overlap area)

-- PART C: Service Gap Analysis
-- Identify areas within the study region that are more than 10 miles from any visitor facility
-- Create a "service desert" analysis

SELECT
    -- TODO: Create a comprehensive gap analysis showing:
    -- Areas not covered by any facility within 10 miles
    -- Protected areas that lack adequate facility coverage
    -- Transportation routes that pass through service gaps
    -- Recommendations for facility placement to fill major gaps

-- PART D: Emergency Response Buffer Modeling
-- Model emergency response capabilities using ranger stations with different response time buffers

SELECT
    -- TODO: Create emergency response analysis:
    -- 15-minute response buffers (assume 30 mph average speed = 7.5 mile radius)
    -- 30-minute response buffers (15 mile radius)
    -- Count facilities and monitoring stations within each response zone
    -- Identify monitoring stations outside 30-minute response areas
    -- Calculate total population coverage (estimate based on facility capacity)

ORDER BY -- TODO: Choose appropriate ordering for your analysis results

-- ===================================================================
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- Your analysis should demonstrate:
-- - Multi-distance buffer creation and area calculations
-- - Service area overlap identification and quantification
-- - Gap analysis showing underserved areas
-- - Emergency response capability assessment
-- - Evidence-based recommendations for facility improvements
-- ===================================================================

-- AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS (use as needed):
-- ST_Buffer(), ST_Intersection(), ST_Difference(), ST_Union()
-- ST_Area(), ST_Transform(), ST_DWithin(), ST_Intersects()
-- Multiple table joins, subqueries, CASE statements, aggregate functions

-- ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
-- 1. All distance calculations must use appropriate coordinate transformations
-- 2. Include both area measurements and overlap percentages
-- 3. Provide actionable insights for facility planning
-- 4. Consider multiple buffer distances for different service levels
-- 5. Account for geographic constraints (elevation, wilderness status)

-- SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-- - Accurate multi-distance buffer calculations
-- - Meaningful overlap analysis between service areas
-- - Identification of service gaps with supporting evidence
-- - Professional-quality spatial analysis workflow
-- - Clear recommendations based on spatial analysis results
