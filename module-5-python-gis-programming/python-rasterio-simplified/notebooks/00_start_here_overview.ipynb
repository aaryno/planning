    "### 🎯 Focus on Learning, Not Just Completing\n",
    "- **Read the notebook explanations carefully** - understand why each step matters\n",
    "- **Run the example code** to see how rasterio works with real data\n",
    "- **Experiment** with the sample raster files to understand their structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Debugging Strategies\n",
    "1. **Read error messages carefully** - rasterio gives helpful error information\n",
    "2. **Check your data files** - make sure sample data exists and is accessible\n",
    "3. **Test with small windows first** - avoid memory issues with large rasters\n",
    "4. **Print intermediate results** - see what your arrays actually contain\n",
    "5. **Compare with notebook examples** - make sure you understand the approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Efficiency Tips\n",
    "- **Work incrementally** - implement one TODO at a time\n",
    "- **Test frequently** - catch errors early before they compound\n",
    "- **Use descriptive variable names** - `elevation_data` instead of `data`\n",
    "- **Keep functions simple** - follow the patterns from notebooks\n",
    "- **Handle edge cases** - check for empty files, invalid coordinates, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗺️ Rasterio-Specific Tips\n",
    "- **Always use context managers** - `with rasterio.open(path) as src:`\n",
    "- **Check your coordinate systems** - make sure CRS is what you expect\n",
    "- **Handle NoData values** - mask them out before calculations\n",
    "- **Use windowed reading** - for memory efficiency with large files\n",
    "- **Preserve metadata** - copy CRS and transform info when creating subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🆘 When You're Stuck\n",
    "1. **Re-read the relevant notebook section** - examples show working code\n",
    "2. **Check the test error message** - it tells you exactly what's expected\n",
    "3. **Verify your sample data** - use `rasterio info` command to check files\n",
    "4. **Ask on the course forum** with specific error messages and code snippets\n",
    "5. **Come to office hours** for personalized help with complex issues"
