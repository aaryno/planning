-- PostGIS Spatial Analysis Assignment - Query 10
-- Multi-Criteria Spatial Decision Analysis Challenge
-- ===================================================================
--
-- OBJECTIVE: Implement a comprehensive multi-criteria decision analysis
-- (MCDA) system to solve a complex real-world spatial planning problem
-- using advanced PostGIS operations and decision science principles.
--
-- BUSINESS CONTEXT: You are a senior GIS analyst for the National Park
-- Service Rocky Mountain Region. The agency has received federal funding
-- to establish ONE new Emergency Response and Environmental Monitoring
-- Facility to enhance visitor safety and ecological protection across
-- the Colorado mountain region. The facility will cost $15 million and
-- must serve for the next 30 years.
--
-- Your task is to identify the optimal location using quantitative
-- spatial analysis that balances multiple competing objectives and
-- stakeholder priorities.
--
-- POINTS: 2 (Ultimate challenge - problem statement only)
-- ===================================================================

-- DECISION PROBLEM:
--
-- The National Park Service Director requires a data-driven recommendation
-- for facility placement that optimizes the following strategic objectives:
--
-- OBJECTIVE 1: EMERGENCY RESPONSE COVERAGE (30% weight)
-- - Minimize response times to existing visitor facilities
-- - Maximize coverage of high-visitation protected areas
-- - Ensure accessibility during seasonal weather conditions
-- - Prioritize areas currently underserved by ranger stations
--
-- OBJECTIVE 2: ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS (25% weight)
-- - Maximize proximity to critical monitoring stations
-- - Ensure coverage of multiple ecosystem types (elevation zones)
-- - Prioritize watersheds with limited current monitoring
-- - Support multi-parameter environmental data collection
--
-- OBJECTIVE 3: TRANSPORTATION ACCESSIBILITY (20% weight)
-- - Minimize construction costs via existing road access
-- - Ensure year-round operational accessibility
-- - Consider helicopter landing capabilities for emergencies
-- - Balance remote location needs with logistical efficiency
--
-- OBJECTIVE 4: CONSERVATION IMPACT MINIMIZATION (15% weight)
-- - Avoid high-sensitivity wilderness areas
-- - Minimize fragmentation of wildlife habitat corridors
-- - Respect indigenous cultural sites and traditional use areas
-- - Comply with endangered species habitat protection requirements
--
-- OBJECTIVE 5: OPERATIONAL SYNERGIES (10% weight)
-- - Leverage proximity to existing infrastructure
-- - Enable coordination with partner agencies
-- - Support multi-use facility development potential
-- - Consider future expansion and adaptation capabilities
--
-- CONSTRAINTS AND REQUIREMENTS:
-- • Facility must be within the study region boundary
-- • Minimum 2-mile buffer from existing major facilities
-- • Maximum elevation 9,500 feet (construction and winter access)
-- • Must be within 15 miles of a major transportation route
-- • Cannot be located within Wilderness Areas or National Parks
-- • Must be within 30 miles of at least 3 monitoring stations
-- • Total construction site must not exceed 50 acres impact area

-- ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
--
-- Your multi-criteria decision analysis must:
--
-- 1. GENERATE CANDIDATE LOCATIONS
--    Create a systematic grid or point-based candidate location system
--    covering the feasible study area while respecting constraints.
--
-- 2. IMPLEMENT SCORING METHODOLOGY
--    Develop quantitative scoring systems (0-100 scale) for each objective
--    using appropriate spatial analysis functions and distance calculations.
--
-- 3. APPLY WEIGHTED DECISION MODEL
--    Combine individual criterion scores using specified weights to
--    calculate composite suitability scores for each candidate location.
--
-- 4. PERFORM SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
--    Demonstrate how changes in weighting priorities affect optimal locations.
--
-- 5. GENERATE DECISION RECOMMENDATIONS
--    Identify the top 3 candidate locations with supporting quantitative
--    evidence and implementation considerations.
--
-- DELIVERABLE EXPECTATIONS:
--
-- Your SQL analysis must produce a ranked list of candidate locations with:
-- • Geographic coordinates and site descriptions
-- • Individual criterion scores with justifications
-- • Weighted composite scores and ranking methodology
-- • Implementation feasibility assessment
-- • Risk factors and mitigation strategies
-- • Executive summary suitable for federal decision-makers
--
-- PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS:
--
-- This analysis will be used to justify a $15 million federal investment
-- and must meet professional consulting standards for:
-- • Methodological rigor and spatial accuracy
-- • Transparent and defensible decision criteria
-- • Comprehensive consideration of stakeholder interests
-- • Risk assessment and uncertainty acknowledgment
-- • Clear communication of technical results to non-technical audiences
--
-- SUCCESS CRITERIA:
--
-- ☐ Mathematically sound multi-criteria decision framework
-- ☐ Appropriate use of PostGIS spatial analysis functions
-- ☐ Accurate distance and area calculations with proper coordinate systems
-- ☐ Logical constraint enforcement and feasibility screening
-- ☐ Defensible weighting and scoring methodologies
-- ☐ Clear identification of optimal location with supporting evidence
-- ☐ Professional-quality analysis suitable for federal decision-making
--
-- NOTE: This is an open-ended capstone challenge that requires you to
-- synthesize all PostGIS skills developed in this assignment series.
-- There is no single correct answer - demonstrate analytical creativity,
-- technical competence, and professional judgment in your approach.
--
-- Your solution should reflect the sophisticated spatial analysis
-- capabilities expected of senior GIS professionals in government
-- and consulting environments.

-- CHALLENGE LEVEL: Expert
--
-- This problem requires original algorithm development, creative
-- problem-solving, and advanced PostGIS expertise. Success indicates
-- readiness for professional-level spatial analysis responsibilities.
