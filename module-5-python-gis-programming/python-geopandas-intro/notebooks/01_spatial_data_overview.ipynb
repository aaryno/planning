    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand:\n",
    "- What makes spatial data different from regular data\n",
    "- Common spatial data formats used in GIS\n",
    "- How GeoPandas extends Pandas for spatial analysis\n",
    "- The basic structure of spatial datasets\n",
    "- Why coordinate reference systems matter\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is Spatial Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial data represents information about the **location and shape** of geographic features. Unlike regular data that just has numbers and text, spatial data includes **geometry** - the actual geographic coordinates that define where things are located on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Data vs. Spatial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Data (like a CSV file):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "City Name    | Population | Country\n",
    "-------------|------------|--------\n",
    "New York     | 8,336,817  | USA\n",
    "London       | 8,982,000  | UK\n",
    "Tokyo        | 13,960,000 | Japan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Data (like a Shapefile):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "City Name    | Population | Country | Geometry (Coordinates)\n",
    "-------------|------------|---------|----------------------\n",
    "New York     | 8,336,817  | USA     | POINT(-74.006, 40.714)\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like regular data comes in different formats (CSV, Excel, JSON), spatial data has its own formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Shapefile (.shp)** - The Classic\n",
    "- Most common vector format in GIS\n",
    "- Actually multiple files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, etc.)\n",
    "- Widely supported by all GIS software\n",
    "- Good for: Traditional GIS workflows, desktop analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **GeoJSON (.geojson, .json)** - The Web Favorite  \n",
    "- Text-based format, human-readable\n",
    "- Perfect for web mapping applications\n",
    "- Single file contains everything\n",
    "- Good for: Web maps, APIs, data sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **GeoPackage (.gpkg)** - The Modern Choice\n",
    "- SQLite-based, single file\n",
    "- Can store multiple layers\n",
    "- Open standard, no licensing issues\n",
    "- Good for: Modern GIS projects, mobile mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **KML/KMZ** - The Google Earth Format\n",
    "- XML-based format\n",
    "- Great for visualization\n",
    "- Good for: Google Earth, simple visualizations"
