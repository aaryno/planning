**Assignment:** Python GeoPandas Introduction  
**Course:** GIST 604B - Open Source GIS Programming  
**Module:** 5 - Python GIS Programming

---

## üéØ Purpose of This Document

This document provides guidance for instructors on managing the **Windows vs Unix environment challenge** that affects most open-source GIS courses. The strategies outlined here can be applied to any assignment involving spatial libraries (GeoPandas, GDAL, PostGIS, etc.).

## üö® The Core Problem

### Why Windows Creates Issues for GIS Programming

**Technical Reality:**
- Most open-source GIS tools were designed for Unix-like systems (Linux/Mac)
- Windows creates compatibility barriers:
  - Complex GDAL/GEOS library installations
  - DLL hell and dependency conflicts
  - Path separator differences (`\` vs `/`)
  - Case sensitivity issues
  - Permission and access problems

**Educational Impact:**
- Students spend more time troubleshooting than learning
- Instructor time consumed by OS-specific technical support
- Inconsistent learning experiences between students
- Windows students may fall behind or become frustrated

### Student Population Considerations

**Typical GIST 604B Class Composition:**
- 60-70% Windows users (many non-technical backgrounds)
- 25-30% Mac users
- 5-15% Linux users
- Most students are NOT Unix-savvy
- Programming experience varies widely

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solution: GitHub Codespaces

### Why Codespaces Works

**Technical Benefits:**
- Ubuntu Linux environment with all spatial libraries pre-installed
- Consistent experience for all students regardless of local OS
- No local installation or configuration required
- Full VS Code environment with extensions

**Educational Benefits:**
- Students focus on learning GIS concepts, not OS troubleshooting
- Uniform experience enables better peer collaboration
- Instructor can provide consistent guidance to all students
- Eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem

**Practical Benefits:**
- Free GitHub education accounts provide generous Codespaces hours
- Accessible from any device with a web browser
- Automatic environment setup via .devcontainer configuration
- Integrates seamlessly with GitHub Classroom

### Implementation Strategy

**In Assignment Instructions:**
1. **Lead with the Windows warning** (as implemented in README.md)
2. **Make Codespaces the default recommendation** for all students
3. **Position local development as advanced/optional** for Mac/Linux users
4. **Be explicit about support boundaries**

**In Class Communication:**
- Announce the policy clearly in the first class
- Explain the technical rationale (not just "because we said so")
- Emphasize this prepares them for real-world GIS work (which is mostly Unix-based)

## üõ°Ô∏è Support Policy Framework

### Clear Boundaries

**What We Support:**
- ‚úÖ All Codespaces-related issues
- ‚úÖ GIS concepts and spatial analysis questions
- ‚úÖ Python programming and GeoPandas functionality
- ‚úÖ Assignment requirements and expectations

**What We Don't Support:**
- ‚ùå Windows-specific installation problems
- ‚ùå Local environment configuration issues
- ‚ùå OS-specific path or permission problems
- ‚ùå Package manager conflicts on local machines

### Communication Templates

**For Course Syllabus:**
```
Technical Environment Policy:
This course uses open-source GIS tools designed for Unix environments. 
Windows users must use GitHub Codespaces for assignments. Local 
development is supported for Mac/Linux only. Instructor cannot provide 
Windows-specific technical support.
```

**For Student Emails About Windows Issues:**
```
Hi [Student],

I see you're experiencing [specific Windows issue]. This is exactly 
why we recommend GitHub Codespaces for this course.

Please:
1. Go to your assignment repository
2. Click "Code" ‚Üí "Create codespace on main"
3. Continue with the assignment in that environment

This will resolve your issue and provide a consistent learning 
experience. I cannot provide support for Windows-specific technical 
problems, but I'm happy to help with any GIS concepts or assignment 
questions once you're in Codespaces.

Best regards,
[Instructor]
```

## üìä Managing Student Expectations

### Proactive Communication Strategies

**Week 1 Announcement:**
- Explain the technical reality of open-source GIS
- Position this as professional preparation
- Demonstrate Codespaces setup in class
- Address questions early before frustration builds

**Assignment Instructions:**
- Lead with environment warnings (implemented in README)
- Provide step-by-step Codespaces setup
- Include troubleshooting sections that redirect to Codespaces

**Ongoing Reminders:**
- Include environment reminders in weekly announcements
- Celebrate students who successfully use Codespaces
- Share success stories to encourage adoption

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Repository Configuration

**Required Files:**
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Codespaces environment definition
- `setup_student_environment.py` - Environment validation script
- Enhanced README.md with Windows warnings

**Codespaces Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "GeoPandas Development",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.11",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {
      "version": "3.11"
    }
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "pip install geopandas matplotlib jupyter contextily folium",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Student Onboarding Process

1. **Assignment Acceptance** ‚Üí Automatic repository creation
2. **Environment Setup** ‚Üí One-click Codespaces creation
3. **Validation** ‚Üí `setup_student_environment.py` confirms readiness
4. **Learning** ‚Üí Focus on GIS concepts, not OS troubleshooting

## üìà Measuring Success

### Metrics to Track

**Technical Success:**
- Percentage of students using Codespaces vs local development
- Time-to-first-successful-run for assignments
