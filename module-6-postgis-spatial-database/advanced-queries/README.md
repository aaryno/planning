docker-compose up -d
python -m pip install -e .
```

#### 🖥️ **Alternative: Local Development**

**Requirements:**
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Python 3.11 or higher

pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Verify Your Environment

#### Database Connection and Performance Test
```bash
# Test database is running with performance settings

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

**❌ Problem:** Queries are running slowly
```bash
# Solution: Check query execution plan and missing indexes
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) 
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE ST_Intersects(geom, query_geom);

# Look for sequential scans and create appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_large_table_geom ON large_table USING GIST (geom);
```

**❌ Problem:** Database running out of memory
```bash
# Solution: Adjust PostgreSQL configuration
docker-compose exec postgis psql -U gis_student -c "
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '256MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '512MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
"
```

### Integration Issues

**❌ Problem:** API connections failing
```python
# Solution: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

session = requests.Session()
retry_strategy = Retry(
    total=3,
    status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
    method_whitelist=["HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS"]
)
adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry_strategy)
session.mount("http://", adapter)
session.mount("https://", adapter)
```

### Complex Query Debugging

**❌ Problem:** Multi-table queries returning unexpected results
```sql
-- Solution: Break complex queries into CTEs for debugging
WITH step1 AS (
    SELECT city_id, geom FROM cities WHERE population > 100000
),
step2 AS (
    SELECT p.park_id, s1.city_id
    FROM parks p
    JOIN step1 s1 ON ST_DWithin(p.geom, s1.geom, 0.01)
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as debug_count FROM step2;
```
