# Python-Rasterio Assignment Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide shows how to replace the current overly complex Python-rasterio assignment with a simplified, student-friendly version appropriate for GIST 604B students.

## 🚨 Current Problem

**The existing assignment is WAY TOO COMPLEX for the target students:**
- 30+ advanced functions requiring professional-level programming skills
- Complex memory management, parallel processing, advanced error handling
- Appropriate for computer science graduates, NOT GIS professionals learning basic Python
- Likely 80%+ failure/incomplete rate

**The solution:** Replace with 8 simple, well-guided functions that teach raster fundamentals.

---

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Backup Current Assignment ✅
```bash
# Create backup of current complex version
cp -r python-rasterio python-rasterio-COMPLEX-BACKUP
```

### Phase 2: Replace Core Files 

#### 2.1 Replace README.md
- **Delete:** Current README.md (too complex)
- **Replace with:** README_SIMPLIFIED.md (already created)
- **Action:** `mv README_SIMPLIFIED.md README.md`

#### 2.2 Replace Source Files
- **Delete:** Current src/rasterio_analysis/ (too complex)
- **Replace with:** src_simplified/rasterio_analysis/
- **Action:** 
```bash
rm -rf src/rasterio_analysis/
mv src_simplified/rasterio_analysis/ src/
```

#### 2.3 Replace Test Files
- **Delete:** Current tests/ (too complex)
- **Replace with:** tests_simplified/
- **Action:**
```bash
rm -rf tests/
mv tests_simplified/ tests/
```

### Phase 3: Add New Supporting Files

#### 3.1 Add Student Helper Files
- **Copy:** `test_my_functions.py` to root directory
- **Copy:** `walkthrough_notebook.ipynb` to root directory
- **Purpose:** Help students test and understand their work

#### 3.2 Add Simple Sample Data
Create `data/` directory with small, simple sample files:
```bash
mkdir -p data/
# Add small example raster files (~10KB each, not hundreds of MB)
```

### Phase 4: Update Configuration Files

#### 4.1 Update pyproject.toml
**Replace the dependencies section with:**
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "rasterio>=1.3.0",
    "numpy>=1.21.0",
    "matplotlib>=3.5.0",
    "pandas>=1.3.0"
    # Remove complex dependencies: stackstac, dask, etc.
]
```

#### 4.2 Update GitHub Workflows
**Simplify .github/workflows/check.yml:**
- Remove complex performance benchmarks
- Remove memory usage tests
- Keep only basic functionality tests

### Phase 5: Update Documentation

#### 5.1 Update All References
- **COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** → Update function count (30+ → 8)
- **INSTRUCTOR_NOTES.md** → Add section on simplified approach
- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** → Update for new simple structure

```bash
# Simple test runner they can use while developing
python test_my_functions.py

# Run official tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Interactive learning
jupyter notebook walkthrough_notebook.ipynb
```

## 💡 Key Success Indicators

### Students Should Be Saying:
- ✅ "This helped me understand how raster data works"
- ✅ "I can see how to use this in my work"
- ✅ "The step-by-step comments were really helpful"
- ✅ "I want to learn more about raster analysis"

### Students Should NOT Be Saying:
- ❌ "This is impossibly hard"
- ❌ "I don't understand what any of this does"
- ❌ "I'm just copying code without learning"
- ❌ "I hate programming now"

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Students Still Struggle:
1. **Check the comments** - Are they detailed enough?
2. **Check the examples** - Do they clearly show what to do?
3. **Check the error messages** - Are they helpful?
4. **Consider office hours** - What questions are students asking?

### If Completion Rate is Still Low:
- **Reduce complexity further** - Maybe make it 5 functions instead of 8
- **Add more examples** - Show more worked examples
- **Create video walkthrough** - Some students learn better with video
- **Pair programming** - Have students work in pairs

### If Students Finish Too Quickly:
- **Add optional extensions** - Advanced students can do extra credit
- **Create follow-up assignment** - Build on this foundation
- **Encourage exploration** - Point them to more advanced resources

## 📚 Additional Resources for Students

### Recommended Learning Path After Assignment:
1. **Complete this assignment** - Master the basics
2. **Explore rasterio documentation** - Learn more functions
3. **Try real-world datasets** - Apply to their own projects  
4. **Learn about Earth Engine** - Scale to cloud computing
5. **Study remote sensing** - Understand the science behind the data

### Connection to Real Work:
This simplified assignment teaches the core skills that GIS professionals use daily:
- **Environmental consulting:** Analyze land cover change
- **Urban planning:** Study development patterns
- **Agriculture:** Monitor crop health
- **Emergency response:** Assess disaster impacts
- **Climate research:** Track environmental changes

## 🏆 Final Notes

This simplification transforms the assignment from a computer science exercise into a practical GIS skills workshop. Students learn the same core concepts but through guided exploration rather than complex implementation.

**The goal:** Students leave excited about raster analysis and confident they can apply these skills in their professional work.

**Success metric:** Students use rasterio in their final projects or thesis work because they understand how valuable it is.
