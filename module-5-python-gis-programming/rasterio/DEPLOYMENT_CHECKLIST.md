## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### GitHub Actions CI Testing
- [ ] **Create test repository** with assignment content
- [ ] **Trigger CI pipeline** and verify it runs without critical failures
- [ ] **Check dependency installation** completes successfully
- [ ] **Verify test discovery** finds all 7 test modules
- [ ] **Confirm grading calculation** produces expected output format
- [ ] **Test on clean environment** (no cached dependencies)

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Clone fresh copy** of assignment repository
- [ ] **Run setup script**: `python setup_student_environment.py`
- [ ] **Verify directory creation** and environment reporting
- [ ] **Test import structure**: `from src.rasterio_analysis import *`
- [ ] **Check function signatures** match test expectations
- [ ] **Validate CI workflow** runs without syntax errors

### Performance Verification
- [ ] **Memory usage reasonable** during test execution
- [ ] **Timeout settings appropriate** (45 minutes total)
- [ ] **Error handling graceful** for missing dependencies
