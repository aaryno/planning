## 🎯 Standardized Notebook Pattern

### Core Structure
Every assignment now follows this pattern:

```
assignment/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── 00_start_here_overview.ipynb        # Student navigation guide
│   ├── 01_function_[name].ipynb            # Function 1 learning notebook
│   ├── 02_function_[name].ipynb            # Function 2 learning notebook
│   ├── [additional function notebooks...]
│   └── [final function notebook]
├── src/
│   └── [module].py                         # Implementation target
└── tests/
    └── test_[module].py                    # Automated testing
```
