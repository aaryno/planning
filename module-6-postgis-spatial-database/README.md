## üóÑÔ∏è Database vs. File-Based Storage

### When to Use PostGIS Spatial Databases

**‚úÖ Choose PostGIS When You Need:**
- **Multi-user Access:** Concurrent editing and querying
- **Data Integrity:** ACID transactions and constraints
- **Complex Queries:** Advanced spatial analysis with SQL
- **Large Datasets:** Efficient indexing and query optimization
- **Integration:** Connection with web applications and APIs
- **Enterprise Security:** Role-based access and audit trails

**üìÑ Stick with Files When You Have:**
- **Simple Analysis:** Basic operations with desktop GIS
- **Single User:** Individual projects without sharing needs
- **Small Datasets:** Under 100MB of spatial data
- **Visualization Focus:** Primary need is mapping, not analysis
- **Desktop Workflow:** Working entirely within QGIS/ArcGIS
