    "## 💡 Essential Tips for Spatial Analysis Success\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Focus on Understanding, Not Just Completing\n",
    "- **Read the notebook explanations carefully** - spatial concepts build on each other\n",
    "- **Run the example code** to see how GeoPandas operations work\n",
    "- **Experiment** with the spatial data to understand coordinate systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗺️ Master Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)\n",
    "- **Geographic CRS (EPSG:4326)**: Latitude/longitude - good for display, bad for measurements\n",
    "- **Projected CRS (UTM zones)**: Meter-based - required for accurate areas and buffers\n",
    "- **Always check your CRS**: `gdf.crs` - most spatial errors come from CRS issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Debugging Strategies\n",
    "1. **Read error messages carefully** - spatial errors often mention CRS or geometry issues\n",
    "2. **Test with simple data first** - use small datasets to debug\n",
    "3. **Visualize your results** - use `gdf.plot()` to see if operations worked correctly\n",
    "4. **Compare with notebook examples** - make sure you understand the spatial logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Efficiency Tips\n",
    "- **Work incrementally** - implement one TODO at a time\n",
    "- **Test frequently** - catch spatial errors early\n",
    "- **Use helper functions** - we've provided CRS and formatting utilities\n",
    "- **Keep functions simple** - follow the patterns from notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🆘 When You're Stuck\n",
    "1. **Re-read the relevant notebook section** - spatial operations have specific requirements\n",
    "2. **Check the test error message** - it tells you what spatial result is expected\n",
    "3. **Look at the sample data** - understand the geometry types and CRS\n",
    "4. **Ask on the course forum** with specific error messages\n",
    "5. **Come to office hours** for personalized spatial analysis help"
