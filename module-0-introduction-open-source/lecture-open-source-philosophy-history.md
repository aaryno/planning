## Core Concepts

### The Four Essential Freedoms
According to the Free Software Foundation:
1. **Freedom 0**: The freedom to run the program for any purpose
2. **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works and change it
3. **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies
4. **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions

### Open Source Definition Principles
1. **Free Redistribution**: No restriction on selling or giving away
2. **Source Code**: Must be available and readable
3. **Derived Works**: Must allow modifications and derived works
4. **Integrity of Author's Source Code**: May require patch files
5. **No Discrimination**: Against persons, groups, or fields of endeavor
6. **Distribution of License**: Rights apply to all recipients
7. **License Must Not Be Specific to a Product**
8. **License Must Not Restrict Other Software**
9. **License Must Be Technology-Neutral**

### Development Models

#### Cathedral Model (Traditional)
- Centralized development
- Limited number of developers
- Infrequent releases
- Closed development process
- Example: Early commercial software

#### Bazaar Model (Open Source)
- Distributed development
- Many contributors
- Frequent releases ("release early, release often")
- Open development process
- Example: Linux kernel, QGIS

## Interactive Elements

### Discussion Questions
1. What motivated early programmers to share their code freely?
2. How do the economic incentives work in open source development?
3. What are the trade-offs between proprietary and open source software?
4. Why might a company choose to open source their software?

### Case Study: QGIS Development
- Started by Gary Sherman in 2002
- Initial motivation: Need for GIS on Linux
- Community growth and governance evolution
- Current status: Major alternative to commercial GIS
- Funding model: Donations, sponsorships, consulting

### Philosophical Debate
**Free Software vs. Open Source**: What's the difference?
- **Free Software**: Emphasizes user freedoms and ethics
- **Open Source**: Emphasizes practical development benefits
- **Both**: Use similar licenses but different messaging

---

## Key Figures

### Richard Stallman
- Founded GNU Project and Free Software Foundation
- Created GPL license and copyleft concept
- Emphasized ethical dimensions of software freedom

### Linus Torvalds
- Created Linux kernel in 1991
- Demonstrated feasibility of large-scale open source projects
- Later created Git version control system

### Eric S. Raymond
- Wrote "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
- Co-founded Open Source Initiative
- Articulated business case for open source

### Tim Berners-Lee
- Invented the World Wide Web
- Chose not to patent web technologies
- Demonstrated power of open standards

---

## Modern Implications

### Why Open Source Matters in GIS
1. **Transparency**: Algorithms and processes are visible
2. **Customization**: Can be modified for specific needs
3. **Cost**: No licensing fees (though implementation costs exist)
4. **Innovation**: Rapid development and feature addition
5. **Interoperability**: Open standards and formats
6. **Longevity**: Not dependent on single vendor
7. **Education**: Source code available for learning

### Business Models
- **Service and Support**: Red Hat, Canonical
- **Dual Licensing**: MySQL, Qt
- **Open Core**: Basic version open, premium features proprietary
- **Consulting**: Implementation and customization services
- **Hosted Services**: Cloud-based offerings
