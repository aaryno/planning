## 👥 Student-Centered Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
1. **Progressive Complexity**: Build skills incrementally from foundation to specialization
2. **Practical Focus**: Every function teaches GIS-applicable skills
3. **Professional Context**: Connect to real-world GIS workflows
4. **Guided Learning**: Extensive comments and step-by-step instructions
5. **Immediate Feedback**: Testing provides rapid development cycles

### Student Workflow Design
```bash
# Modern uv-based development process
1. Read README.md instructions

## 🧪 Testing and Assessment Framework

### Professional Unit Testing with pytest

**Why pytest**: Industry-standard framework teaching professional development practices consistently across all assignments

#### Test Organization
```python
# Test structure follows this pattern across all assignments:
class TestFunctionName:
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        # Arrange: Set up test data
        # Act: Run the function
        # Assert: Verify expected results
        
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        # Test unusual inputs, empty data, errors
        
    def test_integration(self):
        # Test function interactions
        
    def test_advanced_features(self):  # Advanced assignments only
        # Test professional-level capabilities
```

#### Test Categories by Assignment Type

**Foundation Assignments**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function validation (80% of tests)
