    "\n",
    "**Buffer Zones:**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Areas within a specified distance of geographic features\n",
    "- **Applications**: Service areas, impact zones, safety perimeters, noise buffers\n",
    "- **Geometry Types**: Works with points (circular buffers), lines (corridor buffers), polygons (expanded areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Units:**\n",
    "- **Metric**: meters (m), kilometers (km)\n",
    "- **Imperial**: feet (ft), miles (mi)\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Requires projected coordinate systems for precise measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overlap Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Individual Areas**: Sum of all buffer areas (may include overlaps)\n",
    "- **Actual Coverage**: Total area covered after merging overlapping buffers\n",
    "- **Overlap Percentage**: Proportion of buffer area that overlaps with other buffers\n",
    "- **Coverage Efficiency**: Ratio of actual coverage to individual buffer areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate System Considerations:\n",
    "- **Geographic CRS**: Inaccurate for distance-based operations\n",
    "- **Projected CRS**: Required for accurate buffer calculations\n",
    "- **Equal-area projections**: Best for area-based analysis\n",
