  - Rapid conflict resolution
  - Efficient decision-making process
  - Strong project identity and direction

- **Disadvantages**
  - Single point of failure (bus factor = 1)
  - Potential for autocratic decision-making
  - Succession planning challenges
  - May discourage diverse participation

### Case Study Deep Dive: The Python Governance Transition (10 minutes)

**Background**: Guido van Rossum stepped down as BDFL in 2018 after 30 years
- **Pre-2018**: Benevolent Dictator model with Guido having final say
- **Crisis**: PEP 572 (assignment expressions) created community division
- **Transition**: Multiple governance models proposed and evaluated
- **Resolution**: Python Steering Council elected by core developers

**Discussion Questions**:
1. What triggered the need for governance change?
2. How did the Python community handle the transition?
3. What are the benefits and risks of the new model?
4. What lessons apply to other projects facing similar transitions?

### Governance Design Challenge (8 minutes)

- **Initial Team**: 5 developers from 3 different companies
- **Expected Growth**: 50+ contributors within 2 years
- **Stakeholders**: Academic researchers, government agencies, private companies
- **Technical Scope**: Core processing engine + plugin ecosystem

**Task**: Design a governance structure addressing:
1. Decision-making authority and processes
2. Contributor progression and recognition
3. Conflict resolution mechanisms
4. Corporate vs. community balance
5. Long-term sustainability planning

**Groups present**: 2-minute pitches with class feedback
