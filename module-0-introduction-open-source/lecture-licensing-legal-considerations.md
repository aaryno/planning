## Lecture Outline

### I. Introduction: Why Legal Matters in Open Source (10 minutes)

- **The Legal Foundation of Open Source**
  - Copyright law as the basis for software licensing
  - How open source licenses create legal permissions
  - The difference between public domain and open source
  - Why "free" doesn't mean "no legal obligations"

- **Common Legal Misconceptions**
  - "Open source means no copyright protection"
  - "You can use open source software however you want"
  - "All open source licenses are the same"
  - "Commercial use is always prohibited"

- **Real-World Legal Consequences**
  - GPL enforcement cases and settlements
  - Corporate compliance programs and audits
  - Due diligence in mergers and acquisitions
  - Patent litigation involving open source projects

### II. Fundamental License Categories (15 minutes)

#### A. Copyleft Licenses (Strong Reciprocal) (5 minutes)

**GNU General Public License (GPL) Family**
- **GPL v2**: Original copyleft license
  - Requires source code disclosure for distributed modifications
  - "Viral" effect extends to derivative works
  - Patent protection provisions
  - **Example Projects**: Linux kernel, Git, MySQL

- **GPL v3**: Enhanced protyleft with modern provisions
  - Anti-tivoization clauses (hardware restrictions)
  - Enhanced patent protection and retaliation
  - Compatibility improvements with other licenses
  - **Example Projects**: GCC, Bash, QGIS

- **Affero GPL (AGPL)**: Network copyleft
  - Extends copyleft to network/SaaS deployments
  - Requires source disclosure for web service modifications
  - Prevents "SaaS loophole" in traditional GPL
  - **Example Projects**: MongoDB (historically), Neo4j

**Lesser GPL (LGPL)**
- Designed for software libraries
- Allows linking without GPL obligations
- Modifications to LGPL code must remain LGPL
- **Example Projects**: GTK, Qt (dual licensed)

#### B. Weak Copyleft Licenses (4 minutes)

**Mozilla Public License (MPL)**
- File-level copyleft (not project-wide)
- Allows mixing with proprietary code
- Patent grant and retaliation clauses
- **Example Projects**: Firefox, Thunderbird

**Eclipse Public License (EPL)**
- Business-friendly copyleft alternative
- Module-based copyleft boundary
- Strong patent protection provisions
- **Example Projects**: Eclipse IDE, JUnit

**Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)**
- Sun/Oracle created license
- File-based copyleft like MPL
- Incompatible with GPL (deliberate design choice)
- **Example Projects**: OpenSolaris, GlassFish

#### C. Permissive Licenses (6 minutes)

**MIT License**
- Shortest and simplest permissive license
- Minimal restrictions: attribution only
- Compatible with almost all other licenses
- **Example Projects**: jQuery, Rails, Node.js

**BSD Licenses**
- **2-Clause BSD**: Similar to MIT, attribution requirement
- **3-Clause BSD**: Adds non-endorsement clause
- **4-Clause BSD**: Historical advertising clause (now deprecated)
- **Example Projects**: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Django

**Apache License 2.0**
- Most comprehensive permissive license
- Express patent grant from contributors
- Trademark protection provisions
- Contributor License Agreement compatibility
- **Example Projects**: Apache HTTP Server, Android, Kubernetes

**ISC License**
- Functionally equivalent to MIT
- Preferred by OpenBSD project
- Cleaner legal language
- **Example Projects**: OpenSSH, bind

### III. License Compatibility and Legal Interactions (15 minutes)

#### A. Compatibility Matrix and Mixing Rules (8 minutes)

**Understanding License Compatibility**
- **Upstream Compatibility**: Can you use code in your project?
- **Downstream Compatibility**: Can others use your combined work?
- **One-way vs. Bi-directional Compatibility**
- **The Role of License Exceptions**

**Common Compatibility Scenarios**
```
MIT → GPL v3         ✓ (Permissive to Copyleft)
GPL v2 → GPL v3      ✓ (With "or later" clause)
GPL v3 → MIT         ✗ (Copyleft to Permissive)
GPL v2 → Apache 2.0  ✗ (Incompatible copyleft)
BSD → Apache 2.0     ✓ (Permissive to Permissive)
LGPL → GPL           ✓ (Weak to Strong Copyleft)
```

**Multi-License Projects**
- **Dual Licensing**: MySQL, Qt commercial exceptions
- **License Choice**: User selects preferred license

**Distribution Triggers and Obligations**
- **Internal Use**: Generally no distribution obligations
- **Binary Distribution**: Source code availability requirements
- **Network Services**: AGPL vs. GPL differences
- **Cloud Deployment**: Modern hosting considerations

**Real-World Boundary Cases**
- **Linux Kernel Modules**: Binary vs. source distribution
- **JavaScript Libraries**: Client-side execution context
- **Container Images**: Bundling multiple licensed components
- **API Integration**: Service consumption vs. code inclusion
